***Hi! Hey! Hello! Welcome!***

Everybody! Everyone of you! Every fictkin! Every SYS/alters! Every furries! Every Therians! All of you are welcome here!! No one is left out in my sight!!! <33

***About me!:***

I'm Chris! I go by Christopher, Kris, Acid or Waters!! I do have a real name that's used by closest friends & my partner. Please respect that and never use it to address me!
- I'm currently 16, will turn 17 soon in 3 months! ^^
- I'm a very quiet, but friendly type of person! I act nonchalant (dread head...), but worry not!; I'm very calm most of the time and will talk to you when I can!
- On ponytown, I will be shown as offline so do not worry about me unfriending you! I only do with a reason or I couldn't remember you...
- I will block freely depending on behavior, words and actions. It doesn't have to be in pony town only, this includes Discord, Github, any other social medias involved...
- I have a romantic partner (M,17), I will turn down ANY confessions!
- I'm a very affectionate person! Everything I say to you or anyone as a friend will be seen as a platonic act! I do not carry any romantic feelings in any way!

***BYI!:***

- I can be very blunt with you! please don't get upset with whatever I say!! :(
- I can be nonverbal at times due to my Chromebook lagging or I feel really out of place. I will express myself with gestures or will whisper back to you if you did first! ^^
- Be honest with me. if you have a problem with me, at least take the time to talk to me about it! it's ANNOYING!
- NEVER make fun of my mental health! I am trying to better myself but getting pushed down by my guardians even more, so please don't do the same!!
- Minors below the age of 13 are on thin ice! I will only allow being friends and nothing MORE!
- People above the age of 19+ are also on thin ice, I don't like your sketchy intentions unless you're only being friends w me/or talking to me normally ^^
- RESPECT ALL BOUNDARIES!! Everyone and every friend!
- PLEASE! Always inform me if I'm associated with a problematic person within a fandom!! It doesn't matter who and I will always keep a heads up!
- Be aware: I have a watchlist available at all times, you're being watched and have your conversations/actions monitored by me. ***REASON:*** This is all merely for my own satefy and for others! I am a person who keeps a lookout for possible weirdos. Be careful of what you say.
- I do not associate myself with problematic people nor any drama involved! It is not my role to be standing in between the crossfire nor to be taking sides until proven guilty.
- I do not vent unless you're a favorite person/comfort person I hang out a lot with! Vent dumps without warning will result you on getting a blunt response in that matter.
- Do not vent to me unless you're a friend/close friend, All vents are welcome as long you are truthful and honest. There are some vents I will not be able to help with.
