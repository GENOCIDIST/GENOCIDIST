# All about me!!!

- I'm Chris or Christopher!! (Kris is fine too,,,)
- I'm above the age of 16 ^^
- I like homestuck, undertale and partially eddsworld...
- I am an artist and animator!
- I have a real name that's only used by close friends/loved ones, so please respect that and do not use it to address me!
- I can be a blunt and high opinion type person.

# Things you should know before interacting w me!

- If I am blunt about the things I say, I mean it and don't be upset over it.
- Do not vent to me if you're not a friend or without letting me know, I don't know how to help you if that happens.
- Do not make me talk to you about myself/about my problems & struggles unless we're friends.
- DNI basic cetera, darkship/proship/comship is a hard no from me, attacking people without any good reason...
- respect me and other people's boundaries! a block will be resulted!
- (For pony town users), If I dress as a character that is problematic by lore; please keep in mind that I simply only like how they look or the character itself!
- (also pony town users), Please do not engage in inappropiate actions towards or with me, I do not appreciate it!
